# NextJS Express TRPC Starter

A starter to get started with NextJS on the front-end, Express JS on the backend, connecting the two using TRPC (also using Zod for type safety)

The server code is from [this repository by web dev simplified](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/trpc-express-comparison)

It was shown in this video by them: [Is tRPC The End Of REST/GraphQL?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxnPMB0Jc7E&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified)
